## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/anyformat-workshop.git
cd anyformat-workshop

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/anxkhn/anyformat-workshop.git
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Verify installation
uv run anyformat --version
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update main branch
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-brief-description
# or
git checkout -b feat/brief-description
# or
git checkout -b docs/brief-description
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Pick an issue** from the [Issues page](https://github.com/anxkhn/anyformat-workshop/issues)
2. **Comment** on the issue to claim it
3. **Create a branch** following the naming convention
4. **Make changes** following code style guidelines
5. **Write/update tests** for your changes
6. **Run tests** to ensure they pass
7. **Commit** with a descriptive message
8. **Push** to your fork
9. **Open a Pull Request**

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Code style (formatting, etc.) |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring without changing behavior |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |

### Examples

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "fix(image): correct RGBA to RGB conversion for JPEG"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions for Windows"
git commit -m "test(batch): add tests for parallel conversion"
git commit -m "feat(video): add support for custom codec selection"

# Bad commit messages (will fail CI)
git commit -m "fixed bug"
git commit -m "updated code"
git commit -m "changes"
```

### Scopes

Use appropriate scope for your changes:
- `image` - Image conversion module
- `video` - Video conversion module  
- `audio` - Audio conversion module
- `config` - Configuration
- `paths` - Path utilities
- `batch` - Batch processing
- `probe` - Media probing
- `cli` - Command line interface

## Code Style

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) conventions
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Write docstrings for public functions and classes

### Example

```python
def convert_image(
    input_path: str,
    output_path: str,
    quality: str = "medium",
) -> None:
    """Convert an image to a different format.

    Args:
        input_path: Path to the input image file.
        output_path: Path to the output image file.
        quality: Quality preset (low, medium, high).

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If input file doesn't exist.
        ValueError: If output format is not supported.
    """
    pass
```

### Running Linter

```bash
# Check for issues
uv run ruff check src/

# Auto-fix issues
uv run ruff check --fix src/

# Format code
uv run ruff format src/
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- All new features must have tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Maintain minimum 70% coverage for new code

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_config.py

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run only failing tests (useful for debugging)
uv run pytest -x
```

### Test Structure

```python
class TestFeatureName:
    """Tests for feature X."""

    def test_normal_case(self, temp_dir):
        """Test normal operation."""
        pass

    def test_edge_case(self, temp_dir):
        """Test edge cases and boundary conditions."""
        pass

    def test_error_handling(self, temp_dir):
        """Test error conditions and exceptions."""
        pass
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. All tests pass locally
2. Code passes linter
3. Branch is up to date with upstream/main
4. Commit messages follow conventions
5. PR description is complete

### PR Template

Your PR should include:

- Reference to the issue being fixed
- Description of changes made
- How to test the changes
- Any breaking changes or migration notes

### Review Process

1. Automated checks must pass (commit format, PR description)
2. At least one maintainer review required
3. Address all review comments
4. Squash commits if requested

### After Merge

- Delete your feature branch
- Update your local main branch
- Celebrate your contribution!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Git Mistakes

1. **Committing to main** - Always create a feature branch
2. **Large commits** - Break changes into logical, atomic commits
3. **Missing upstream updates** - Regularly fetch and merge upstream
4. **Ignoring CI failures** - Fix issues before requesting review

### Code Mistakes

1. **Hardcoded paths** - Use cross-platform path utilities
2. **Missing error handling** - Handle exceptions gracefully
3. **Ignoring type hints** - Maintain type safety
4. **No documentation** - Document public APIs

### Testing Mistakes

1. **Testing only happy path** - Include edge cases and errors
2. **Using global state** - Use fixtures for isolation
3. **Ignoring test failures** - Fix failing tests before PR
4. **Missing assertions** - Every test needs assertions
